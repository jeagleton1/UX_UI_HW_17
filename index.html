                  <p>Hello, there!  My name is Jenn - UX/ UI Designer, with a passion for creating the best digital experience possible. I’m a recent transplant to Atlanta from New York City, where I spent 8+ years building my career in the fashion industry as a buyer and business driver. 
                    I believe maintaining a user centered design focus throughout the design thinking process is paramount and should drive all decisions.  I’m highly collaborative [plays well with others], driven and adaptable.
                    I would love to have the opportunity to work together!</p>
